The following project is an ongoing program that will allow two players to play the game of chess.

The source code written for this project does its best to emphasize the following:

- Java Encapsulation
- Google's coding style based on the Google Java Style Guide
- Javadoc documentation (also based on the Google Java Style Guide)
